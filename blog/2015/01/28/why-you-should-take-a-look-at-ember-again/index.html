<div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I gave a talk at the <a href="http://frankfurtjs.org">FrankfurtJS</a> Meetup on this topic and
it generated quite a bit of interest. The motivation behind it was actually quite selfish, I needed
a bit of pressure to dive into Ember.js a bit more and what better way to do that than to try
and explain it to a room full of people?</p>

<p>By now most front-end developers have certainly heard of Ember.js and many have even given it a try.
So how could I combine an introduction with a bit more current info on the framework? Well,
there have been significant changes in the past 6 months that in my opinion warrant another look
at the framework even if you have evaluated it thoroughly before.</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="3d3f1dc0851801328fc62e7b8af14da2" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

<p>Following is a brief summary of the talk and a list of all the resources that were discussed. The
demo application that was written as part of the live coding session will be discussed in a separate
post.</p>

<h2>What is Ember.js?</h2>

<p>Taken straight from the official website:</p>

<blockquote><p>A framework for creating ambitious web applications</p></blockquote>

<p>What does that mean? Because Ember.js is highly opinionated (and proud of it) it allows for larger teams
to be very productive with it. This comes from its stand on &#8220;Convention over Configuration&#8221;, which
basically means &#8220;The Ember way or the highway&#8221;, but it also means that once you get over the
admittedly steep learning curve you will be able to focus on building your application and not
worrying about the mundane small stuff like where to put your files and how to name things.</p>

<p>Yehuda Kats gave a really good talk at <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3337-railsconf-keynote-10-years">RailsConf</a>
about the concept of &#8220;Cognitive Depletion&#8221;. In a nutshell it means that the human brain only has a limited
amount of cycles per day to make decisions and after a limit is reached you become fatigued and in turn
less productive. He does a really good job of explaining this and even backs it up with
scientific studies on this subject.</p>

<p>The strong conventions that Ember.js and <a href="http://ember-cli.com">ember-cli</a> enforce also result
in a project structure that lets new team members become familiar with a project they have never
seen very quickly.</p>

<p>And lastly <em>Ember.js is optimized for developer happiness.</em> Maybe this sounds cheesy, but this is
what got my attention about Ember.js in the first place. In a talk or podcast that Tom Dale and
Yehuda Kats were on they talked about their mission to create a framework that makes and keeps developers
happy to do their job. This is a hard one to explain because it really has to do with every aspect
of Ember.js and its community but once it clicks you will know what I mean.</p>

<h2>Who is behind Ember.js?</h2>

<p>Yehuda Kats and Tom Dale are the two guys that started it, but there are now <a href="http://emberjs.com/team/">9 other core team members</a>
from a variety of companies and places around the world. And of course there are many community members
that are contributers to Ember.js in a variety of ways.</p>

<h2>The Community</h2>

<p>The Javascript community in general seems to be made up of a bunch of friendly enthusiastic people, but
the Ember.js community in particular is extremely helpful and welcoming.</p>

<h4>IRC</h4>

<p>On the #emberjs IRC channel I have never seen comments like &#8220;RTFM&#8221; or the likes. In fact, in the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pON2erqemDY">opening keynote</a> at <a href="http://emberconf.com/">EmberConf 2014</a> Tom and Yehuda spent
considerable time on explaining the code of conduct for the Ember community and what it means to make
people feel welcome.</p>

<h4>Questions &amp; Discussions</h4>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ember.js">Stackoverflow</a> is of course a great place to ask questions, I have
<a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> configured to look there for my programming questions.
For more involved discussions check out the <a href="http://discuss.emberjs.com/">discussion forum</a> hosted on Discourse, which coincidentally is
one of the first Ember.js apps to appear in the wild, and its <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">open source</a>.</p>

<h4>Conferences</h4>

<p>There are at this point in time two Ember.js conferences. One is in the US - <a href="http://emberconf.com">EmberConf</a> - and the other
is in Europe - <a href="https://emberfest.eu/">Ember Fest</a>.</p>

<h4>Meetups</h4>

<p>If you are fortunate enough to have an Ember.js meetup near you - GO! A list of the currently active
meetups can be found <a href="http://emberjs.com/community/meetups/">here</a>.</p>
