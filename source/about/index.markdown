* I am from Austria
* I was once a mechanical engineer, but did not like it
* I lived in the US for a long time
* My hobbies keep me rather stationary
* My children keep me moving
* When I step outside at night I look up. My wife does the same, I love that
* I consider practically all reality TV shows to be mental pollution, actually most everything on TV is mental pollution
