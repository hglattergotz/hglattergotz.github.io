The following is a helpful list of where to find current information on Ember.js:
<!--more-->

* The best place to start is the Ember website itself [emberjs.com](http://emberjs.com).
  The docs live there and on the blog you can find current news on the project.
* [Ember Weekly](http://emberweekly.com/) is a newsletter all about ember. It is an
  outstanding aggregation of what is happening in the Ember ecosystem.

Two recent podcasts with great info about the upcoming Ember 2.0 release:

* [__Frontside the Podcast: Ember 2.0 and the Indie Web with Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale__](https://frontsidethepodcast.simplecast.fm/16)  
  This is a fairly new podcast that I came across recently. This episode from December
  23rd 2014 features Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz and they talk about current work on
  Ember.js.  
    
  Highlights:
  * HTMLBars - Complete replacement of the render engine
  * FastBoot - server side rendering
  * Important aspects of running a successful OSS project  
  
* [__The Changelog: The road to Ember 2.0 with Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz__](http://thechangelog.com/131/)  
  Similar info to the previous one

* The Ember.js [Meetup in NYC](https://www.youtube.com/user/EmberNYC) is probably one of the most professional I have found.
  The meetings are all recorded and core team members speak there on a regular basis.
